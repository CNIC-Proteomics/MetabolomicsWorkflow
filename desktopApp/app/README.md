## app

Inside the app there is the *index.js* file, corresponding to the **main process** and from which the graphical user interface (GUI) will be opened. In addition, inside the app we can find four directories:

- **assets**: The assets folder contains the cascading style sheets (CSS), images and other files used to develop the GUI.
- **sections**: The sections folder contains the HTML files (in addition to the associated CSS and JS files) of the two main sections of the application: *Help* and *Execute*. The *Help* section allows the user to consult the documentation of the program, while the *Execute* section allows the user to design a customized workflow.
- **jobs**: The jobs folder contains the directories with the results of the workflows executed by the user.
- **src**: The src folder contains the code and files necessary for the execution of the workflow.

## tools

The tools folder contains an *errorCode.json* file that assigns certain information to some of the possible error codes generated by the program, namely: the **module** that generated the error, **description** of the error and its **associated code**. This information will be used by the desktop application and the web server to properly inform the user in the event of a workflow error.

Furthermore, tools folder contains **four directories** corresponding to each of the modules that make up TurboPutative. In these directories we can find the Python script of the module and a file in INI format from which the script will take the parameters for execution.

REname folder also contains a INI file with the regular expressions (regex.ini) used by the module to process the name of the compounds.
In the Tagger folder there is a subfolder called dbs, which contains the nutrient and drug lists (*food_databse.tsv* and *drug_database.tsv*) used by Tagger to perform the classification of compounds. In addition, dbs folder contains the scripts used to generate nutrient and drug lists.

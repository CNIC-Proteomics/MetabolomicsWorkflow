## partial

The partial folder contains the HTML documents that serve as templates for the server. Thus, the *putativejob.html* file allows generating the loading page that appears after launching the workflow, while the *executionError.html* file allows generating the error pages that are sent to the user in the event of a problem in the execution of the workflow.

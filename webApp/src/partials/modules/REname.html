            The tables with the candidate metabolites obtained from the monoisotopic mass of the significant analytes 
            (using softwares such as 
            <a href="http://ceumass.eps.uspceu.es/mediator/index.xhtml" target="_blank">Ceu Mass Mediator 3.0</a>, 
            <a href="http://omics.georgetown.edu/metabosearch.html" target="_blank">MetaboSearch</a> or 
            <a href="https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/landing_page.php?pgcontent=mainPage" target="_blank">XCMS</a>) 
            contain multiple generic annotations, 
            with limited utility for the researcher and with many repetitions. 
            Thus, many of the candidate metabolites assigned to the same feature are isomeric compounds 
            or compounds that may appear reported in the databases following different nomenclature, 
            as is the case of acids and their conjugated bases. In order to facilitate the visualization of 
            the tables and the extraction of useful information by the researcher, we have developed REname, 
            an analyzer capable of identifying isomeric and equivalent compounds based on their names to merge 
            them under a single annotation.
            <br>
            <br>
            REname uses a 
            <a href="https://github.com/CNIC-Proteomics/TurboPutative/blob/master/tools/REname/regex.ini" target="_blank">regular expression system</a> 
            that allows the modification of 
            the name of compounds to eliminate information related to isomerism (<i>e.g.</i> position of functional groups, 
            double bonds and chirality, among others). In the case of compounds that are not isomers but can have different forms, 
            such as acid and base, all compounds are converted to one of their forms (<i>e.g.</i> converting all acids to bases). 
            After applying the regular expressions, REname identifies the metabolites that must be fused under a 
            single annotation by comparing the names obtained after processing.

            The regular expressions used by REname are in a file with INI format, divided into sections with different parameters. 
            Each of the sections represents a processing unit applied to the name of the compounds. Thus, the section has two parameters 
            with different functions. The first one contains the regular expression that allows detecting a certain combination of 
            characters in the compound name. The second parameter contains the characters that will replace the string detected by 
            the regular expression. Each of these processes are applied sequentially on the name of the compounds.

            However, there are compounds that 
            receive additional treatment by REname. This is the case of peptides and lipids that have fatty acids 
            in part of their structure (<i>e.g.</i> phospholipids, sphingolipids and glycerolipids).
            <br>
            In the first case, REname combines under a single annotation those peptides that have the same amino acid composition, 
            although with a different sequence. Thus, only one of the compared sequences will be kept. For this, amino acids must 
            be expressed in the three-letter nomenclature.

            In the case of fatty acid lipids, further processing is performed using the 
            <a href="https://github.com/lifs-tools/pygoslin" target="_blank">Goslin</a> package. 
            Goslin can process the name of lipids from different databases (<i>e.g.</i> LipidMaps, SwissLipids, HMDB ...) and 
            classify them thanks to a system of parsers and predefined grammars. The information extracted from the name 
            of the lipid is stored in an <i>object</i> with a fixed structure, which facilitates the programmer's access to the 
            information of interest. In this Project we are interested in extracting the following information from lipid compounds:

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Header group (<i>e.g.</i> PE or phosphoethanolamine).</li>
                <li>Total number of carbon atoms in fatty acids.</li>
                <li>Total number of double bonds in fatty acids.</li>
                <li>Type of bond (ether or vinyl ether) of fatty acids.</li>
                <li>Number of hydroxyl and methyl groups in fatty acids.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            After processing, REname can fuse those isomeric lipids by comparing the names obtained.

            Regarding its execution, REname must receive as input a table in <i>xls</i> or <i>xlsx</i> format. 
            It must have at least two columns with the mass of the extracted features (Experimental mass) 
            and the name of the annotated compounds (Name). Likewise, the user can modify some parameters of 
            the module and considerably alter the processing of the name of the compounds. For example, 
            it is possible to change the regular expression system used by REname.
